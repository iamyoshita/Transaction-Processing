Test1: Read operations:
- No matter how many transactions or operations in each transaction, Read do not have any conflict. 
- We used 10 transactions with 12 Read operations each, with mix order (to force conflict possibility).
- No DeadLocks or abort, all transactions commit normally.
- DeadLock Detection is called and never cought a cycle or issue.

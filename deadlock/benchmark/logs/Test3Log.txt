Test3: WriInsertte operations with deadlock detected:
- 10 Different transactions, all insert 4 times on independent records, 
then this graph is created on the 5th operation:
	
	T0 -> T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4 -> T5 -> T6 -> T7 -> T8 -> T9 -> T0 
 
The cycle of 11, starting from T0 and looping back, generates a deadlock.
This deadlock is resolved by aborting one transaction, when it happens; the rest will perform normally.

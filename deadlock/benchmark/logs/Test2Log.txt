Test2: Processes .. with all Insert operations

- This test is similar in operations in each Transaction as Benchmark Test3. 
- The difference is the mode used. Here it is "Process"
- Even though, there is a loop created by the operations as follows:
	
	T0 -> T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4 -> T5 -> T6 -> T7 -> T8 -> T9 -> T0 
 
- DeadLock detects nothing, and the reason is that every T releases the resource once it is done. 
    DeadLocks are not possible.
- All operations and transactions happen with no problem.
